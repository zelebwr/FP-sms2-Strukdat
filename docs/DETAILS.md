# PROJECT DETAILS
This file will list all the details about the nitty gritty details on the project.

## 1. Route Scope 
Route scope can reach up to the whole nation, i.e., Indonesia.

## 2. Transportation Preference
The available transportation listed: 
1. Bus
2. Train
3. Boat
4. Plane

Each transportation has different classes: 
1. Economy
2. Executive
3. Business
4. First-class

## 3. Route Attribute
Each route, corresponding with the transportation and its class, will have unique attribute values, which all will consist of: 
1. Travel Time 
2. Travel Distance
3. Travel Cost

## 4. Program Algorithm 
The concept of the program is that it uses weighted graph that depends on each route's attributes determined by the **adjacency list** using __A* Algorithm__.

## 5. User Preference
The program can dynamically determine the "optimal path" depending on the user's preference, which are: 
1. User Priority (which priorities are more prioritized)
2. Route Attribute
3. Amount of Transit
4. Transportation Type
5. Transportation Class
